// A Sequential Control Structure is the default mode of execution in C programming. In this structure, instructions are executed one after another in the order they appear — from top to bottom.

// ✅ Example 1: Simple Arithmetic Operations
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;
    int sum = a + b; // Adding two numbers
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum); // Output the result
    return 0;
}
// ✅ Example 2: Variable Declaration and Initialization
#include <stdio.h>
