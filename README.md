# ⭐ C Pattern Programs

This repository contains various **pattern printing programs** written in the **C programming language**. These examples demonstrate the use of **control structures**, especially **loops (for, while, do...while)** and **nested loops**, to produce common programming patterns like pyramids, triangles, diamonds, and Pascal’s Triangle.

## 📝 About

Pattern programs are commonly used to teach the fundamentals of:

* **Looping and nested loops**
* **Decision-making**
* **Mathematical logic**
* **ASCII/character manipulation**

They are essential for building logic and understanding flow control in C programming.
